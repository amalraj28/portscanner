# portscanner
It scans the required number of ports, starting from 1, of the ip addresses that the user enters.

The user is asked to enter the ip addresses that they want to scan, and the number of ports. 

The program then scans those ports and then prints out which ports are open.

Libraries imported:
  1. `socket` --> To establish connection to the ports of the IP
  2. `colored` Class of `termcolor` library --> To print the output in different colours and styles.
